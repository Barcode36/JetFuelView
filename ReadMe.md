JetFuelExplorer can be launched by right clicking on the amps instance in the view. This is a very powerful tool that can help you to do great things with amps. You can do the following 
* Subscribe to data and view the data in nice tables, tree or text format
* Draw graphs on various stats
* Publish test data, record and playback data
* Much much more

It is more advanced version of the spark tool that comes with amps. Have a look at this site https://jetfuel.solutions/ for more details.
